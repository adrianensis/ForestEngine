# TODO

- [ ] Shadow Mapping - Border clamp : https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Shadows/Shadow-Mapping
- [ ] Shadow Mapping - Use Ortho matrix for directional (the sun) light
- [ ] UI - Fix scale on resize
- [ ] Hide backface for 2D sprites (optional, since some sprites could rotate?)
- [ ] Test frustum culling, enable back
- [ ] Add Option for SSBO to be readonly

## Vulkan Port
- [ ] Decouple Window.hpp from IWindowInputAdapter
- [ ] Decouple Window.cpp from RenderEngine
- [ ] Decouple Vulkan::findRequiredExtensions from GLFW
- [ ] Decouple GPUContext from WindowManager
- [ ] Decouple GPUProgram from ObjectBase
- [ ] Decouple GPUTexure from ObjectBase
- [ ] Decouple GPUMesh from ObjectBase
- [ ] The VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library extensions allows separate compilation of different parts of the graphics pipeline. With this itâ€™s now possible to split up the monolithic pipeline creation into different steps and re-use common parts shared across different pipelines. [Optimize Graphics Pipeline](https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/extensions/graphics_pipeline_library/README.html)

## Interesting / Nice To Have / Optimizations

- [ ] Animation Blending
- [ ] persistent buffers -> this allows multithreading buffer update
- [ ] Texture Arrays
- [ ] Sparse Textures
- [ ] Compress textures? Why/When?

- Use Octree to calculate visibility? (frustum culling with octree?). Don't put model matrix in UBO if occluded.
- Threads - split render and logic in different threads
  - Scripting Engine - Put scripting engine in another thread???
  - Tasks system - threaded?
- Implement "next frame" timers

### ECS (cache friendly)

- Components live in Pools/Comp.Managers
- Inheritance is a 1st class citizen in OOP, composition is a 1st class citizen in ECS.
- OOP encourages encapsulation of data, ECS encourages exposed POD (plain old data) objects.
- OOP colocates data with behavior, ECS separates data from behavior.
- OOP Object instances are of a single static type, ECS entities can have multiple, dynamically changing components
- [from here](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/82030/how-are-entity-systems-cache-efficient)

  - No inheritance/virtual functions allowed since jumping to vtable mem address generate cache misses
  - That should go for systems
  - QuadTree could live in a packed array, better cache performance
